                                Nanotechnology refers to the scientific study and 
                            utilization of very small structures whose size ranges 
                            between 1 nanometer (nm) up to 100 nanometers. 
                            The term "nano" originated from the Greek word nanos 
                            which means dwarf. Nano denotes 10ยบ or one-billionth of a 
                            meter.

                                Various fields of study contribute to nanotechnology, 
                                including materials science, molecular physics, chemistry, 
                                biology, computer science, electrical science, and 
                                mechanical engineering. Unique phenomena occur at the 
                                nanoscale that is why scientists are so 
                                interested at imaging, measuring, manipulating, modeling, 
                                and utilizing nanoparticles (www.understandingnano.com).

                                PhilGeneStrips is cost-efficient, easy to use in the field, 
                                and has the ability to properly identify those with the 
                                disease as well as those without. It can also detect White 
                                Spot Syndrome (WSS) virus. 
                                WSS is a viral infection which is contagious and can quickly 
                                lead to death. This innovation is very helpful for 
                                elimination of diseases in shrimps that firstly benefits 
                                the farmers.

                                Another innovation of nanotechnology in the country is the 
                                creation of water treatment system called the Portable 
                                Ceramic Water Filter (Pitcher Type). 
                                Through the principle of gravity, the two-liter capacity 
                                water filter is able to sift tap or deep well water using 
                                red clay with nanotechnology silver coating as the primary
